# Machine Learning Tasks 

## About
This repository contains implementations of various tasks assigned as part of the Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) by The Sparks Foundation. The tasks cover different aspects of machine learning, data analysis, and predictive modelling.

## Tasks
1. **Task 1: Prediction Using Supervised Learning**[Link](https://github.com/Ayushma00/ml-datascience-tasks/blob/main/task_work/Prediction%20Using%20Supervised%20Learning.ipynb)
   - Implementing predictive models using supervised learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, etc., to make predictions based on labeled data.

2. **Task 2: Prediction Using Unsupervised Learning**[Link](https://github.com/Ayushma00/ml-datascience-tasks/blob/main/task_work/Prediction%20Using%20Unsupervised%20Learning.ipynb)
   - Implementing unsupervised learning techniques like clustering or dimensionality reduction to uncover patterns or structures in data without labeled responses.

3. **Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis | Retail** [Link](https://github.com/Ayushma00/ml-datascience-tasks/blob/main/task_work/SampleSuperstore%20eda%20task.ipynb)
   - Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a given dataset related to retail business. This involves visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics, trends, and patterns within the data to derive insights.

4. **Task 4: Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm** [Link](https://github.com/Ayushma00/ml-datascience-tasks/blob/main/task_work/Decision%20tree.ipynb)
   - Building predictive models using decision tree algorithms to classify or regress data based on a series of decisions inferred from the features.

5. **Task 5: Stock Market Prediction using Hybrid Numerical and Textual Analysis** [Link](https://github.com/Ayushma00/ml-datascience-tasks/blob/main/task_work/Stock%20Market%20Prediction.ipynb)
   - Developing a model that combines numerical analysis of stock market data with textual analysis of news articles or social media sentiment to predict stock prices or market trends.

## Requirements
- Python (3.x preferred)
- Required libraries specified in each task's implementation
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for easy visualization and code execution)

Feel free to contribute by adding solutions to the existing tasks or proposing new tasks to be included in the repository. Pull requests are welcome!
